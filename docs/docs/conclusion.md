# Conclusion

The **Crypto Price Tracker** provides a simple and effective way to fetch and display cryptocurrency prices. The project demonstrates:
- **Next.js** for frontend development.
- **CoinGecko API** for real-time crypto prices.
- **React Context API** for efficient state management.
- **Docusaurus** for structured documentation.

For further improvements, we can:
- Implement user authentication.
- Store user preferences (e.g., favorite coins).
